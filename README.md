# Weather_Correlation_to_Deer_Hunting
Created a Python web scrapper to collect weather data to compare it to deer hunting success rates over the past 25 years

I developed a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding the impact of weather conditions on deer hunting success rates. The project began with the creation of a web scraper using the Selenium package in Python to collect detailed weather data for October and November from 1999 onward. The data was cleaned and organized in Excel before being exported as CSV files for further analysis in Python.

Once the data was prepared, I compared the collected weather data to various deer hunting statistics obtained from the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) website. To uncover potential relationships, I conducted linear regression analyses to explore the correlation between weather variables and hunting success rates. Additionally, I performed regression tests to determine the statistical significance (p-values) of each weather variable in relation to hunting outcomes.

Finally, to effectively communicate my findings, I utilized Power BI to create visualizations that highlighted the key insights from the analysis, making it easier to interpret the results and understand the influence of weather on deer hunting success.
